Create a plan for covering a major news event during the initial breaking news cycle and ongoing coverage. Select your team. It must be made of 3 people (in one case there might be a 2 person team). Determine the skills you need and decide what each team member  will be doing.

Then plan an interactive project as part of your coverage and create a paper prototype or wireframe to explain your concept and how it will work.

Your hand-drawn prototype must include:
- A placeholder headline
- A wireframe for each photo and interactive element
- A visual illustration of what happens when a user clicks on interactive elements.
- Here's an example from the class of 2016.
- Youâ€™ll present your idea in front of the class the following week, when you will pretend your - classmates  are the editors of your publication and provide critique.
- Extra points if you write a clear one page Manifesto that includes: Users, Needs, Goals/Purpose, what you will do and what elements you will include and what you will not do.
