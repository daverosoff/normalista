## Note

This syllabus is a work in progress developed in collaboration by all the IDJ Fall 2016 instructors. The lesson plan is subject to change depending on the progress and success of the students in the class. Any changes will be notified to students.

## Course Description

This three-credit course introduces students to conceptualizing and producing content across multiple platforms --from Web sites to tablets and mobile devices-- by exploring essential concepts, tools,  and interactive story forms.

This course reviews how the news industry is adapting to new technologies and ways to map or illustrate data and news. Students will also explore ways to work with data for storytelling and add interactivity to storytelling.

More specifically, this course introduces students to a) obtaining, analyzing and presenting data for storytelling b) getting acquainted with project planning for an audience, prototyping techniques, core design and style concepts c) learning the basics of HTML/CSS, c) fine tuning editorial judgement by analyzing stories and interactive data projects d) create stories with charts and maps. They'll also learn about existing frameworks, libraries and concepts . We'll explore all these tools and technologies within the journalistic context of pitching, reporting, producing data and interactive news packages.

The course covers fundamental technical skills that will serve as the foundation for your data and interactive work at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.
